# Real-Time Low-Light Image Enhancement for AR/VR

**Goal**: Improve clarity and quality of noisy/low-light images and videos from AR/VR headsets in real time, while ensuring energy-efficient deployment on-device.

A complete implementation featuring classical computer vision methods, deep learning models (U-Net & ViT), self-supervised training, and hardware optimization for AR/VR applications.

## What's Built

### Datasets
- **Public**: LOL dataset, SID (See-in-the-Dark) dataset support
- **Custom**: Webcam low-light video capture with synthetic data generation
- **AR Simulation**: Meta Aria AEA compatible data processing

### Methods
- **Classical Baseline**: Histogram Equalization, CLAHE, Gaussian/Bilateral filters (400+ FPS)
- **Deep Learning**:
  - U-Net (fast, effective for enhancement)
  - Vision Transformer (ViT) variant (benchmarking against U-Net)
  - Self-supervised training with Noise2Noise

### Hardware Efficiency
- Trained in PyTorch on Apple Silicon (MPS backend)
- Quantization support (int8/fp16)
- Export to ONNX + Core ML for iOS/macOS deployment

### Evaluation
- **Objective**: PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS metrics
- **Subjective**: Side-by-side video comparisons
- **Efficiency**: ms/frame runtime, FPS achieved, memory footprint

### Demo / Tools
- Interactive Streamlit/Gradio dashboard
- Sliders for "before/after", quality metrics, runtime, and efficiency plots

## Features
