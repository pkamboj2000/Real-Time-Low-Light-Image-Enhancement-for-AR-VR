# TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] Test with real AR headset video feeds (Quest 3, HoloLens)
- [ ] Implement temporal consistency for video enhancement
- [ ] Optimize inference speed further (target <50ms on mobile)
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple images

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] Experiment with attention mechanisms in ViT
- [ ] Add support for different image formats (HDR, RAW)
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement for very dark images
- [ ] Create mobile app demo

## Low Priority
- [ ] Add more classical enhancement methods
- [ ] Explore self-attention in U-Net decoder
- [ ] Create comprehensive benchmark suite
- [ ] Add support for other VR headsets

## Ideas to Explore
- Multi-scale enhancement approach
- Integration with existing AR frameworks (ARKit, ARCore)  
- Real-time noise estimation and adaptation
- User preference learning for enhancement parameters
